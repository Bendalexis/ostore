Vaadin Web UI for OStore

Build with sbt.

To run via jetty use the following sbt command

   container:start


Now point your browser to

   http://127.0.0.1:8080

For development can be run under Tomcat
in Eclipse. Setup is complex!
But this allows code changes to take effect
without restarting Tomcat (jetty does not
support this).
Add the following to the url so reloads will 
pick up changes

   ?restartApplication
